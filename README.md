# bambuser

When clicking a product inside the Bambuser One-to-many player, instead of showing the product details or redirecting correctly, an error page is displayed. The exact error message may vary depending on the implementation, but typically it could be a 404 (not found), 500 (server error), or a JavaScript error in the console. The player may rely on each product having a unique identifier or URL. If the product data in the player is incomplete or misconfigured, clicking the product will trigger an error. The Bambuser player may be integrated with an e-commerce platform or backend API. If the API endpoints or product routes are incorrect, unavailable, or misconfigured, the click action cannot fetch the product data, resulting in an error. Ensure all products displayed in the player have correct URLs, IDs, and are properly registered in the backend system. Confirm that the player can reach the backend endpoints for product details. Test the endpoints independently to see if they return valid data.
